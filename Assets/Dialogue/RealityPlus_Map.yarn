// No text from the book is reproduced; all lines are paraphrase.
//
// HOW THE MAP IS ORGANISED
// Socrates' three regions = the three PhilPapers top-level areas the book draws on.
// Each region holds sub-areas (PhilPapers second-level categories), each staffed
// by 2-3 philosophers. Book concepts are sorted into the area they belong to,
// NOT by the part of the book they come from.
//

//   Metaphysics         Heim, Berkeley, Plato   (Chalmers appears only in technology.yarn)
//       Ch1 Plato's cave | Ch6 five criteria of reality, virtual realism,
//       simulation realism | Ch10 virtual digitalism vs fictionalism |
//       Ch12 AR objects, "alternative facts", relativism | Ch23 Forms, Eden
//   Epistemology        Descartes, Zhuangzi, Moore

//       simulation theology, problem of evil
//
// REGION  SCIENCE, LOGIC, AND MATHEMATICS
//   Philosophy of Computing and Information  Turing, Searle, Wheeler
//       Ch8 varieties of information, it from bit | Ch9 it-from-bit-from-it |
//       Ch15 thinking machines | Ch21 what is computation, dust clouds
//   Philosophy of Physical Science  Russell, Sellars, Galileo
//       Ch22 structuralism, is physics just mathematics, what realizes the
//       structure | Ch23 manifest vs scientific image, colour, solidity, space
//   Philosophy of Probability  Bostrom, Boltzmann

//
// UNITY HOOKS
//   Map_Start        Socrates introduces the map (renamed from Start: technology.yarn owns Start)
//   Talk_Socrates    any later conversation with Socrates
//   Gate_<Area>      put this on the area's LEAD philosopher: sorting test first,
//                    then straight into the lead's own Talk_ node (in-world)
//   Talk_<Name>      proximity trigger for each philosopher
//   $route_to        read this in C# to light the path / waypoint
//   $playtest        false (Unity default) = NPCs <<stop>> so the player walks on
//                    true  = NPCs hand back to an area menu so the whole map
//                            plays from one trigger, for testing without NPCs placed

Socrates: Ah, a visitor. Walk with me a while.
Socrates: Behold, the land lies before you. Could you tell me what you think this land is? Questions, questions and possibilities, of many many different kinds of questions. Every grove is different, every grove holds new questions, new possibilities, and not merely a few impossibilities.
Socrates: Look over there, to the north of us, do you see trees? Of course you do. There are trees to the north of us, but also to the north of us lies Metaphysics and Epistemology.
Socrates: To the east lies Value Theory, where we ask what is good, what is right, and what is just.
Socrates: Over there to the west lies Science, Logic, and Mathematics, where we ask about physics, computers, and probability, and what tell us.
Socrates: Most people arrive carrying one question that troubles them. A singer once put it simply. Is this the real life, or is it just fantasy?
Socrates: My task is to help you discover what KIND of question you are really asking. Then I will send you to the people who can test it.

    Socrates: Earlier you called yourself a relativist. Do you still?
    -> Yes, I still think reality differs from person to person.
        Socrates: Then hold onto it, but test it. Michael Heim in Metaphysics thinks he can break it.
    -> No. Different people can have different experiences of one reality.

    Socrates: You have walked every grove. Now tell me, which kind of question do you find hardest to sort?
    -> Questions about simulations. They seem to belong everywhere.
        Socrates: Yes. That is why Chalmers uses them. One scenario pulls on knowledge, reality, mind, value, and science at once.
    -> Questions about consciousness.
        Socrates: Fair. Consciousness sits in Mind, but it decides questions in Ethics and Probability too.

Socrates: Are you a relativist then?
-> What is a relativist?
    Socrates: A relativist about reality says there is no one way the world is. What is real for you may simply not be real for me.
    Socrates: So. Are you one?
    <<jump Hub_Relativist_Choice>>

Socrates: Which of these is closest to what you meant?
-> Reality itself is different for each person. What is real for me may not be real for you.
    <<set $is_relativist to true>>
    Socrates: Then you are a relativist, and your question is about what exists. That belongs in Metaphysics.
    Socrates: Seek out Michael Heim there. He believes reality exists independently of us, and he will push back hard.
    <<set $route_to to "Metaphysics">>
    <<jump Route_Go>>
-> We only ever reach reality THROUGH our experience.
    Socrates: Then you are not a relativist at all! You are not saying what reality is. You are saying how we come to know it.
    Socrates: That is a question about knowledge. It belongs in Epistemology, where Descartes asks whether experience can be trusted.
    <<set $route_to to "Epistemology">>
    <<jump Route_Go>>
-> Reality is MADE of experience. There is nothing behind it.
    <<set $is_idealist to true>>
    Socrates: That is not relativism either. If reality is made of experiences, you are an idealist, like Bishop Berkeley.
    Socrates: An idealist can think reality is the same for everyone. Idealism is a claim about what reality is made of, so it belongs in Metaphysics.
    <<set $route_to to "Metaphysics">>
    <<jump Route_Go>>
-> Experience is what makes reality matter to me.
    Socrates: Interesting. Now you are speaking of value, of what makes things matter in a life.

Socrates: Physics, then. Are you a physicalist? Do you think only physical things exist?
-> Yes. If physics does not mention it, it is not there.
    Socrates: That is a claim about everything that exists, so it begins in Metaphysics.
    Socrates: But first ask yourself whether minds fit. If you doubt it, the Mind grove will test you.
    -> Send me to Metaphysics.
        <<set $route_to to "Metaphysics">>
        <<jump Route_Go>>
    -> Send me to Philosophy of Mind.
        <<set $route_to to "Mind">>
        <<jump Route_Go>>
-> I mean physics is our best guide to what reality is.
    Socrates: Then here is a sharper question. Does physics tell us what things ARE, or only how they behave and relate?
    Socrates: That is a question for the Philosophy of Physical Science. Bertrand Russell waits there.
    <<set $route_to to "PhysicalScience">>
    <<jump Route_Go>>
-> At bottom, physics might just be information.
    Socrates: A physicist named Wheeler said much the same. Information and computation have their own grove, in the west.

Socrates: A simulation! A world running on a computer in the next universe up. Now, what exactly do you mean?
-> I mean I cannot PROVE that I am not in one.
    Socrates: Then your question is about proof and knowledge. Epistemology. Descartes asked it with an evil demon instead of a computer.
    <<set $route_to to "Epistemology">>
    <<jump Route_Go>>
-> I mean it is actually LIKELY that we are in one.
    Socrates: Likely! Then you are reasoning about probabilities. Nick Bostrom's argument lives in the Probability grove.
    <<set $route_to to "Probability">>
    <<jump Route_Go>>
-> I mean that if we are, nothing around me is really real.
    Socrates: Ah, that is a claim about what is real, not about what you know. Metaphysics.
    Socrates: Michael Heim will argue the opposite, with Chalmers on his side. Even in a simulation, they say, the trees are real trees, made of bits.
    <<set $route_to to "Metaphysics">>
    <<jump Route_Go>>
-> I mean whoever built it would be a kind of god.
    Socrates: Then you are asking what a god is. That is the Philosophy of Religion.

Socrates: Then let me ask. Must the creator be all-good and all-powerful? Or would any creator of our world count?
-> Only a perfect being counts as God.
    <<set $is_theist to true>>
    Socrates: Then you hold the classical conception. Anselm will happily argue with you about it, in the Philosophy of Religion.
    <<set $route_to to "Religion">>
    <<jump Route_Go>>
-> Any creator would count, even a programmer.
    Socrates: A bold answer. Chalmers explores it. A simulator could be all-knowing about our world and yet not good at all.
    Socrates: Go to the Philosophy of Religion and ask whether such a being deserves worship.
    <<set $route_to to "Religion">>
    <<jump Route_Go>>
-> I am not sure God exists. That is my real question.
    Socrates: Then you are asking about arguments for and against God. Still the Philosophy of Religion. Leibniz faces the problem of evil there.

    <<jump Sort_Conscious>>

Socrates: What kind of question is that? About right and wrong action, about what makes a life go well, or about what is real?

    Socrates: No one is doing anything wrong by living in VR, are they? You asked whether the life would be GOOD FOR YOU. Try again.
    <<jump Sort_GoodLife>>
-> About what makes a life go well.
    Socrates: Exactly. Philosophers call it well-being. Nozick built a famous machine to test it.
    <<set $route_to to "WellBeing">>

Socrates: Who should rule. Is that ethics of the individual, or politics of the group?
-> Ethics of the individual.
    Socrates: An individual can ask how to behave. But who holds power over everyone is a question about society. Try again.

Socrates: You are asking what a word refers to. Is that about language, about minds, or about trees?
-> About trees.
    Socrates: Ha! The trees will not mind either way. You asked what your WORD picks out. Try again.
    <<jump Sort_Tree>>
-> About minds.
    Socrates: Words live in minds, true. But the question of what a word hooks onto in the world is the Philosophy of Language.
    <<set $route_to to "Language">>

Socrates: An illusion is a mismatch between how things seem and how they are. Which side do you want to investigate?
-> How things seem to me. My experience and my sense of being there.
    Socrates: Then you are studying perception and presence. That is the Philosophy of Mind. Andy Clark will meet you there.
    <<set $route_to to "Mind">>
    <<jump Route_Go>>

    Socrates: Not quite. You are not asking what rightness is. You are asking about one hard case, simulated people. Try again.
    <<jump Sort_Hurt>>
-> One specific kind of case.
    Socrates: Yes. Specific moral cases are Applied Ethics. Peter Singer will ask you what makes a being count.

Heim: Here is Chalmers's reality checklist. Five questions to ask of anything.
Heim: Does it exist? Does it make things happen? Is it independent of your mind? Is it the way it seems? Is it a genuine example of its kind?
Heim: Which of these does the virtual kitten pass?
-> It exists and makes things happen. It is a pattern of data that changes the screen, and changes me.
    <<set $is_virtual_realist to true>>
    Heim: That is Chalmers's view. He calls it virtual digitalism. Virtual objects are digital objects, real structures of bits on a real computer.
    Heim: It passes existence, causal power, and mind-independence. It fails only genuineness, if you mean genuine cat.
    <<jump Chalmers_SimRealism>>
-> None. It is all in my head.
    Heim: Then how can your friend, in the same virtual world, see it and pet it too? Things in your head alone are not shared.
    -> Fair. Two people can interact with the same virtual object, so it is not just in my head.
        Heim: Then it passes mind-independence. Count again.
        <<jump Chalmers_Checklist>>
    -> My friend just has a similar picture in her head.
        Heim: Then what causes both pictures, at the same time, in the same place? Something on the server does. That something is the digital kitten.

Heim: Are you a relativist then? Is the kitten real for some people and not for others?
-> Yes. In augmented reality, I might see a kitten on the table and you might not. So we live in different realities.
    <<set $is_relativist to true>>
    Heim: Chalmers uses augmented reality to make this vivid. Notice what is true for BOTH of us. You see a kitten overlay. I do not. That is one fact, the same for everyone.
    Heim: Our devices differ. Reality does not. Different glasses do not give us alternative facts.
    -> I accept that. Different experiences, one reality.
        <<set $is_relativist to false>>
        Heim: Then you have just moved from relativism to realism. Reality exists independently of us, even when it contains many virtual worlds.
        <<jump Chalmers_SimRealism>>

    Heim: That is what Chalmers calls simulation realism. If we are in a simulation, the objects around us are real, not an illusion. They are made of bits instead of something else.
    Heim: Notice what that does to Descartes. If a simulation is not an illusion, his nightmare loses its sting.
-> No. Everything would be fake.
    Heim: That is the assumption Chalmers's whole book argues against. If you hold it, Descartes will welcome you in Epistemology.
    Heim: But ask yourself what "fake" means here. The trees would still exist, still cast shadows, still fall on you.

    -> It is made of matter, which causes my perceptions.

    -> Because a computer is always running it.
        Berkeley: Ingenious. Chalmers notes that a simulation could do the job I gave to God. But a computer is not a mind.

    Plato: Then reality comes in degrees. Shadows are less real than things, and things less real than the Forms they copy.
-> Yes. They are real shadows, even if they are not real horses.
    Plato: A shrewd answer. Chalmers would agree. A shadow passes his test for a real shadow and fails his test for a real horse.
-> The prisoners cannot know they are shadows.
    Plato: True, but that is a question about knowledge, and Descartes keeps that grove. I am asking what the shadows ARE.
    <<jump Talk_Plato>>
Plato: Now consider the red of a rose. Many scientists say objects are not really coloured. Colour is only in us.
Plato: Imagine a Garden of Eden, where roses were perfectly, truly red. Have we fallen from that garden?
-> Yes. Nothing is really coloured the way it looks.
    Plato: Then the world you see is an imperfect copy, as my cave said. Chalmers takes a middle path. We lost the perfect red of Eden, but things can still be red in a humbler sense.
-> No. Red just is whatever causes red experiences in us.
    Plato: Then you define colour by what it does. Russell and Sellars, in the Physical Science grove, will like that answer.
-> I do not know. That question seems to belong somewhere else.
    Plato: It belongs in several places at once. Mind, Physical Science, and here. The skill is noticing which strand you are pulling. I am pulling on what is real.

Descartes: Here is the modern version of my evil demon. You cannot rule out that you are in a perfect simulation.
Descartes: And if you are in one, you know nothing about the outside world. So you do not know there is a table in front of you.
Descartes: Where, if anywhere, does that argument go wrong?
-> Nowhere. I must doubt everything.
    <<set $is_skeptic to true>>

        Zhuangzi: A good reason. You are offering evidence, and weighing evidence is what this grove is about.

Putnam: Imagine a planet exactly like Earth, except the clear liquid in its rivers is not H2O. It is a different chemical. Call it XYZ.
Putnam: Your twin there says "water." Does she mean what you mean?
-> Yes. Same word, same thoughts, same meaning.
    Putnam: But she has never met H2O. Her word was learned on XYZ. I say meaning depends partly on the world outside your head.
-> No. Her word refers to XYZ.
    <<set $is_externalist to true>>
    Putnam: Then you are an externalist. What your words refer to depends on what you are actually connected to.
Putnam: Now Sim Earth. People who have lived their whole lives in a simulation say "tree." What does their word refer to?
-> Digital trees. The things they actually interact with.
    <<set $is_externalist to true>>
    Putnam: Then when they say "there is a tree in front of me," they speak the truth. Chalmers uses this to back simulation realism.
-> Physical trees, like ours.
    Putnam: But they have never been in contact with a physical tree. How could their word reach one?
    <<jump Talk_Putnam>>
Putnam: I once argued that a brain that has always been in a vat cannot truly think "I am a brain in a vat," because its word "vat" refers to virtual vats.
Putnam: Does that refute skepticism?
-> Yes. The skeptic's worry cannot even be stated.
    Putnam: Chalmers thinks it helps only partly. It does not work for someone put in a simulation recently, whose words were learned outside it.
-> Only partly. It depends on where my words were learned.
    Putnam: That is the careful answer. Notice we reached a conclusion about knowledge by thinking about language. Groves connect.

Anselm: I defined God as the greatest being that can be conceived. Chalmers asks a humbler question. What would it take to be A god?
Anselm: Suppose a programmer in the next universe up created ours. Is that programmer a god?
-> Yes. Any creator of our world would count.
    Anselm: Then a teenager with a powerful computer could be your god! Chalmers notes such a being could be all-powerful and all-knowing about our world.
    Anselm: But would it be good? Nothing guarantees that.

    Anselm: Then a simulator would be, at most, a lesser god. Not God.
-> Only if it was also good.
    Anselm: Then goodness is part of what you mean by "god." That puts you in Leibniz's debate about evil.
Anselm: Chalmers points out something odd. If we live in a simulation, then a creator exists. The simulation argument becomes a kind of argument for a god.
Anselm: Does that make you more of a believer?
-> Yes. If a creator is likely, so is a god.
    Anselm: Careful. The creator might be a scientist, a gamer, or a machine. Is that the god of any religion?

Searle: One more. A man sits in a room with a rulebook. Chinese questions come in. He follows the rules and sends perfect Chinese answers out. He understands no Chinese.

    Wheeler: Many agree. Structure needs something to fill it. Russell, in the Physical Science grove, takes this further.
Wheeler: If we are in a simulation, our particles are made of bits, and those bits are made of physical processes in the simulator's computer.
Wheeler: So the simulation hypothesis is not a story of illusion. It is a story of creation. Our world built from bits.

    -> They could, but they choose not to.
        Bostrom: Another sim blocker. Perhaps they find it unethical, or boring.
    -> Simulated beings would not be conscious.
        Bostrom: That blocker depends on a question in Philosophy of Mind. If consciousness needs biology, simulated minds are empty.
    -> We are special in some way.
        Bostrom: Chalmers asks this too. But special people might be exactly the ones simulators choose to simulate.
-> It is fifty-fifty. Either we are or we are not.
    Bostrom: That treats two outcomes as equally likely just because there are two. By that logic, winning the lottery is fifty-fifty too.
Bostrom: Chalmers weighs the sim blockers and concludes there is at least about a one-in-four chance that we are sims.
Bostrom: Whatever the number, his real conclusion is this. We cannot know that we are not in a simulation.

Boltzmann: In a universe that lasts long enough, random fluctuations could briefly assemble a brain, complete with false memories of a whole life, floating in the void.
Boltzmann: Could you be such a brain?
-> No. That is absurdly unlikely.
    Boltzmann: Each one is. But in a long enough universe, such brains might outnumber ordinary observers. Many physicists treat a theory that predicts that as broken.
-> Maybe. I cannot rule it out.
    Boltzmann: Then most of your beliefs about the world would be false.
Boltzmann: Here is why this is worse than the simulation case. A simulation has a real, structured world behind your experience. A Boltzmann brain has nothing behind it but chaos.
Boltzmann: Chalmers's simulation realism cannot rescue you here. What do you make of that?
-> This is the hardest skeptical scenario of all.
    Boltzmann: Chalmers agrees. It is one place where his anti-skeptical project runs out of road.
-> Then the theory that predicts Boltzmann brains must be wrong.
    Boltzmann: That is the usual response. Use the absurdity of the conclusion as evidence against the physics.
Boltzmann: Notice that this question lives in two groves. The odds belong here. Whether you can know anything at all belongs to Descartes.

Nozick: Would you plug in for life?

    <<set $is_hedonist to true>>
    Nozick: Then you probably think what matters is how life feels from the inside. Bentham will be pleased with you.

-> Only if real people could be there with me.
    Nozick: Good. Chalmers notes that ordinary VR is not my machine. You know you are in it, and the other avatars can be real people.
Nozick: Chalmers asks what good things a virtual life would be missing. Which worries you most?
-> Real relationships.
    Nozick: In a shared virtual world, your friends are real people behind their avatars. Chalmers thinks friendship survives.
-> Real achievements.
    Nozick: Winning a hard virtual race is still winning it. The skill and effort are real, even if the track is digital.
-> Contact with the real world.

    Bentham: That was my student Mill's correction. Quality, not just quantity. But a virtual concert can be a high pleasure too.
-> No. Because none of it is real.
    Bentham: The pleasure is real, whatever caused it. And Chalmers argues virtual objects are real digital objects, so the causes are real as well.
Bentham: A warning before you leave. I am also a moral theorist. The greatest happiness of the greatest number is a theory of right ACTION.
Bentham: That belongs in Normative Ethics. Here I speak only of what makes a life go well for the one who lives it.
